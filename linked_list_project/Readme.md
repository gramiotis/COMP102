# Linked Lists in C
Two mini projects on linked lists in C

## Project 1
* The user creates a N-length linked list with numbers
* The user can search for a number and modify the list according to the following instructions:
```Text
If the number is found as a node value and the next node has a bigger value,
the current node is being pushed back to the end of the linked list, else
nothing changes.
```

## Project 2
* The user creates a N-length linked list with numbers
* The program iterates the linked list, starting from the first node, and checks if the value of each node is a factor of the sum of the values of the next nodes
* The program prints the results of the above condition
